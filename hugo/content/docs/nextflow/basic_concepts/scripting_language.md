_Nextflow_ is designed to have a minimal learning curve, without having to pick up a new programming language. In most cases, users can utilise their current skills to develop Nextflow workflows. However, it also provides a powerful scripting DSL.

Nextflow scripting is an extension of the [Groovy programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groovy_programming_language), which in turn is a super-set of the Java programming language. Groovy can be considered as Python for Java in that is simplifies the writing of code and is more approachable.

Read the `script-page` section to learn about the Nextflow scripting language.
