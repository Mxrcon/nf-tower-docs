Webhooks allow you to Launch pipelines automatically based on events. Tower currently offers support for native GitHub webhook and a general Tower webhook that can be invoked programatically. Support for native Bitbucket and Gitlab webhooks will be supported soon.

A **Pipeline action** listens to changes in the pipeline repository, when a change occurs Tower trigger the launch of the pipeline as a response.

To create a new **Pipeline action** navigate to the user menu on the top right, select **Pipeline actions** and create a new action.
