## What is Nextflow?

The main thing to understand is that Nextflow -- unlike other workflow management systems -- is both a language and a runtime.

To put it simply, Nextflow is a runtime for the execution of Nextflow pipelines.

Nextflow is the engine


## Why Nextflow Tower?

We created Nextflow in 2013 to deliver the most seamless experience for data pipelines at scale.

Nextflow Tower is the continuation of this mission encompassing the latest technologies.

## Advantages

Choosing to build a static site and use a Git-backed CMS comes with a multitude of advantages over the traditional Monolithic CMS:

### Speed, reliability, and security

Static sites don't require a complicated server setup to allow for the dynamic rendering of pages. This means your sites download faster for visitors, can handle insane volumes of traffic, and have many fewer touch points that are vulnerable to hacking.

### Continuous Deployment

Unlike traditional content management systems, your codebase _is_ your website. That means developers can work on changes to the website locally, and then push to Git and automatically have them deployed to production.

### Unified Workflow

Gone are the days of developers and editors having completely separate workflows. Developers and editors now work in sync with Git, providing unparalleled ability to deliver quickly and easily.
