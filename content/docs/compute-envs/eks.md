## Overview

[Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) is a managed Kubernetes cluster that allows to run containerised workloads in the AWS cloud at scale.

Nextflow Tower offers native support for AWS EKS clusters and streamlines the deployment
of Nextflow pipelines in such environment.

## Requirement

You need to have an EKS cluster up and running. Make sure you have followed
the steps in the [Cluster preparation](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-tower-k8s/blob/master/cluster-preparation.md) guide to create the cluster resources required by Nextflow Tower.


## Compute environment setup  


**1.** In the navigation bar on the upper right, choose your account name then choose **Compute environments** and select **New Environment**.

</br>

**2.** Provide a name for this environment. For example, *My EKS* and select **Amazon EKS** as the target platform.

**3.** Select your AWS credentials or create new ones. The credentials are needed to indentify the user that will access the EKS cluster.

{{% tip %}}
Make sure the user associated with these the IAM permissions required to described and 
list EKS cluster as explained at [this link](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-tower-k8s/blob/master/cluster-preparation.md#4-amazon-eks-specific-setting).

**4.** Specify the AWS *region* where the Kubernetes cluster is located e.g. `us-west-1`. 

**5.** The field **Cluster name** lists all EKS cluster available in the selection region. Choose the one you want to use to deploy the Nextflow execution.

**6.** Speicify Kubernetes **Namespace** that should be used to deployment the pipeline execution. 

If you have followed the example in the [cluster preparation](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-tower-k8s/blob/master/cluster-preparation.md#2-service-account--role-creation) guide this field should be `tower-nf`.

**7.** Specify the Kubernetes **Head service account** that will be used to grant permissions to Tower to deploy the pods executions and related. 

If you have followed the [cluster preparation](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-tower-k8s/blob/master/cluster-preparation.md#2-service-account--role-creation) guide this field should be `tower-launcher-sa`. 

**8.** The **Storage claim** field allows you to specify the storage Nextflow should use as 
scratch file system for the pipeline exection. 

Following the example in the [cluster preparation](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-tower-k8s/blob/master/cluster-preparation.md#3-storage-configuration) guide this should be `tower-scratch`. Change accordingly if you are using a different persistent storage. 


## Advanced options

These options allow fine tuning the Tower configuration for the EKS cluster.

The following parameters are available:

**1.** The **Storage mount path** defines the file system path where the Storage claim is mount. Default: `/scratch`

**2.** The **Work directory** field defines the file system path used as working directory by the Nextflow pipelines. It must be the same or a subdirectory of the *Storage mount path* at the previous point. Defualt: the same as *Storage mount path*.

**3.** The  **Compute service account** field allows you specify the Kubernetes *service account* that the pipeline jobs should use. Default is the `default` service account in your Kubernetes cluster.
