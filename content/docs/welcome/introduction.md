## What is Nextflow?

The main thing to understand is that Nextflow -- unlike other workflow management systems -- is both a language and a runtime.

To put it simply, Nextflow is a runtime for the execution of Nextflow pipelines.

Nextflow is the engine making sure workflows written in the Nextflow language are correctly executed independently of their compute environment.


## Why Nextflow Tower?

We created Nextflow in 2013 to deliver the most seamless experience for executing data pipelines at scale.

Nextflow Tower is the continuation of this mission. Encompassing the latest technologies we have built a platform to easily execute and monitor pipelines across every step. All actions are programatically accessible through our API.
