Each organization can be considered as a collection of workspaces, members, teams as well as collaborations. To better explore these concepts, let us first create an organization.

**1.** To create an organization, click on the dropdown next to your name and select **New organization** to open the creation dialog.

**2.** On the dialog, fill in the fields as per your organization. The **Name** and **Full name** fields are compulsary.

!!! warning
    A valid name for the organization must follow specific pattern. Please refer the UI for further instructions.

**3.** The rest of the fields such as **Description**, **Location**, **Website URL** and **Logo Url** are optional.

**4.** Once the details are filled-in, you can access the newly created organization using the [organizations page](https://tower.nf/orgs), which lists all of your organizations.

!!! tip
    It is possible to change the values of the optional fields either using the **Edit** option on the [organizations page](https://tower.nf/orgs) or using the **Settings** tab within the organization page, provided that you're the **Owner** of the organization 



## Members

Once an organization is created, the user who created the organization is the default owner of that organization. It is also possible to invite/add other members as well.

Tower, provides an access level for invited members of an organization by classifying them either as an **Owner** or a **Member**. Each organization can have multiple owners as well as members.

!!! note
    **Owners** have full read/write access to all the users and resources within an organization, whereas the **members** could 

## Collaborators

**Collaborators** are users which are invited only within an organization workspace, as a result, their access is limited to only within this workspace in an organization. 

New collaborators to an organization workspace can be added using the **Participants**. To further read the various available access levels for **Participants**, please refer the [Organization Workspaces](/orgs-and-teams/organization_workspaces)

!!! note
    A list of all the available **Members** and **Collaborators** can be found at the organization page.


## Teams
